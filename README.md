Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Social Media Clone project! This project is a front-end implementation of a social media platform, designed to mimic the look and feel of popular social networking sites. The main objective of this project is to showcase the use of pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a visually appealing and interactive user interface without incorporating actual user interactions or back-end functionality.

# Tech Stack:

**HTML:** The project uses HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) as the foundation for creating the structure and content of the web pages. HTML is the standard markup language for web development and provides the necessary elements to define the layout and various components of the website.

**CSS:** Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are utilized to enhance the presentation and visual appeal of the social media clone. CSS is responsible for styling HTML elements, including layout, colors, fonts, and other visual properties.

**JavaScript:** JavaScript is employed to add dynamic elements to the project, such as animations, transitions, and any non-functional interactivity to improve user experience. However, it's important to note that this project does not incorporate any back-end or server-side functionalities.

# Project Structure:

The repository is organized into a clean and straightforward structure to make it easy for developers to navigate and understand the codebase. The main directories include:

**index.html:** The entry point of the website and the starting point of the user's journey through the social media clone.

**css/:** This directory contains all the CSS files responsible for styling the web pages. It is further divided into subdirectories for better organization, such as layout, typography, and components.

**js/:** Here, you'll find the JavaScript files that provide the dynamic elements and interactivity to the project. Again, the directory is organized with separate files for different components and functionalities.

**images/:** This directory holds all the necessary images, icons, and other media files used in the project.
